        <h1>How to Play</h1>
        <p>The goal is to convert a set of starting words into a set of goal words. Each word may only be used once. You have access to the following operations:</p>
        <span class="tutorialHeader">
            <button class="popupBtn">To IPA</button>
            /
            <button class="popupBtn">Spell Word</button>
            :
        </span>
        <p>You may convert any word to its IPA form and vice versa. 
        eg. "read" to /ri:d/ or /rɛd/ , and /rɛd/ to "read" or "red".</p>
        <span class="tutorialHeader">        
            <button class="popupBtn">Change Form</button>:
        </span>
        <p>You may convert a word to any of its inflectional variants/other forms. eg. "read" can become "reading" or "reads". 
        "I" can become "me", "my", or "mine".</p>
        <span class="tutorialHeader">        
            <button class="popupBtn">Delete Letters</button>
            /
            <button class="popupBtn">Delete Phonemes</button>
            :
        </span>
        <p>You may delete any letters or phonemes. 
        Eg. change "what" to "hat", or /θɪŋk/ to /θɪŋ/.</p>
        <span class="tutorialHeader">        
            <button class="popupBtn">Merge</button>:
        </span>
        <p>You may merge two words together. 
        eg "thin" and "king" to "thinking".</p>
        <span class="tutorialHeader">        
            <button class="popupBtn">Split</button>:
        </span>
        <p>You may split a word into two words, so long as the split can occur 
        without any letters/sounds left over. So "thinking" to "thin" and "king" would be valid. 
        The thing that is being split must also be a word. So "bighat" to "big" and "hat" is not valid because 
        "bighat" is not a word.</p>
